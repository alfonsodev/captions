NOTE
This file was written by Captions. I hope
you enjoy reading it. Some things to
bear in mind:
- I was lip-reading, so the cues may
not be 100% accurate
- I didn’t pay too close attention to
when the cues should start or end.

I'm going to flip through this deck.

STYLE
::cue(#\31) { color: lime; }

And I want you to see one card.

Not this one. That's too obvious.
